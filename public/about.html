<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ewaen Odutayo, and I am happily married with two lovely kids. I am a banker with a keen interest in tech. Recently, I developed a love for web development, which has led me to venture into this new career path.</p>

<p>I am a strong believer in Christ and am very passionate about helping others. Personal development is a significant priority for me, and I am constantly looking for ways to improve my skills. My favorite quote is, "Nothing is impossible."</p>

<p>For leisure, I enjoy shopping, dancing, and listening to music.</p>
